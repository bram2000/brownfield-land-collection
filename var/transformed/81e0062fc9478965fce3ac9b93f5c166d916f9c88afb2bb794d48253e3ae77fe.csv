In both cases, 30% of the dwelling units shall be affordable. Any proposals should include: a high quality wet and dry sports and leisure facility of up to 6,500sqm; a complementary commercial development, including up to a 100 bed hotel, plus up to 4 units of restaurant space totalling around 400sqm; car-parking to serve the development, along with associated car/coach parking and drop-off area for the adjacent school; and provision for the retention and enhancement of boundary planting on the northern boundary. If required, the current users of the Drill Hall have been provided for at an alternative location. Development of the site should be through a comprehensive masterplan and should focus on an accessible, sustainable and high quality leisure hub facility, creating a landmark leisure destination through high quality buildings and public realm on this highly prominent gateway site into the town.
