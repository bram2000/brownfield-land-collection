The site was formerly used by the NHS for nurses accommodation. The ground floor was last used on a temporary basis as office space to help decant for an Endoscopy department enlargement. The site was surplus to requirements and was put up for sale as a development opportunity. Given its location, its suitability and its availability for residential development it considered that this site provides an opportunity to deliver residential development.
