Collect brownfield land register data from each Local Planning Authority, validate the data, and build a national dataset.

The source list of registers collected is kept and maintained in [dataset/brownfield-land.csv](dataset/brownfield-land.csv).

The [collection](collection) directory contains:

* [collection/log](collection/log) -- log entries by date (sha256 hash of the URL)
* [collection/resource](collection/resource) -- collected files (sha256 of the contents)
* [index.json](collection/index.json) -- an index into the collection, used to build [dataset](https://digital-land.github.io/dataset/brownfield-land/) and other pages

The [validation](validation) directory contains the results of validating each resource as JSON.

# Updating the collection

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

    $ make init
    $ make

Not all of the files can be downloaded automatically. These can be added to the collection using the [addone](bin/addone.py) script;

    $ bin/addone.py ~/Downloads/download.csv https://example.com/inaccessible-site
