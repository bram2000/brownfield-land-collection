If required, the current users of the Drill Hall have been provided for at an alternative location. Development of the site should be through a comprehensive masterplan and should focus on an accessible, sustainable and high quality leisure hub facility, creating a landmark leisure destination through high quality buildings and public realm on this highly prominent gateway site into the town. See Policy BEX4 of the DaSA (https://www.rother.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=32806&p=0). There is an current outline planning application RR/2019/430/P, for the site, inclduing the greenfield element, which is currently undetermined, for up to 52 dwellings and mixed use leisure centre. It is proposed in the DaSA - proposed submission October 2018 - that this site provides a high quality wet and dry sports and leisure facility of around 6,500sqm, as well as a complementary commercial development, including up to a 100 bed hotel, plus up to 4 units of restaurant totalling around 400sqm. Car-parking should also be provided to serve the development, including electric charging points, along with associated car/coach parking and drop-off area for the adjacent school.\""},"OrganisationURI":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"http://opendatacommunities.org/id/district-council/rother"},"OwnershipStatus":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"mixed ownership"},"PermissionDate":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":""},"PermissionType":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"outline planning permission"},"PlanningHistory":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2019/430/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2014/612/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2012/2498/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2012/2475/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2009/667/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2009/262/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2006/2350/DN&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2006/2225/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2006/1636/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2005/3567/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2005/1596/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2003/2986/3R&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2003/127/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2002/3125/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2001/1533/P&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/2001/1536/C&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/97/1913/A&from=planningSearch|http://planweb01.rother.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningDetails?reference=RR/96/18/CI&from=planningSearch"},"PlanningStatus":{"error":{"fix":["permissioned","not permissioned","pending decision"],"message":"This should be 'permissioned, not permissioned, pending decision'"},"row":27,"value":"pending permission "},"SiteNameAddress":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"\"Former High School Site and Drill Halls, Down Road, Bexhill\""},"SiteReference":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"RDCBLR0030"},"SiteplanURL":{"error":null,"row":27,"value":"https://www.rother.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=32771"}},{"Deliverable":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"yes"},"EndDate":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"2019-01-01"},"FirstAddedDate":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"2018-10-01"},"GeoX":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"0.468145"},"GeoY":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"50.840047"},"HazardousSubstances":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":""},"Hectares":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"0.08"},"LastUpdatedDate":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"2019-10-01"},"NetDwellingsRangeFrom":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"11"},"NetDwellingsRangeTo":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"11"},"Notes":{"error":null,"row":28,"value":"\"RR/2018/273/P -
