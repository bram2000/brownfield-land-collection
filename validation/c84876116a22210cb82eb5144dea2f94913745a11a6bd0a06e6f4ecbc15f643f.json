Emerging Local Plan Ref ST2-57 - Site has outline planning permission for 450 residential dwellings and 27,000m2 business floorspace. The additional housing units must form part of a comprehensive redevelopment of the site to include replacement employment provision. This should be of an equivalent scale and skill level to that when the site was fully operational to ensure the District’s economy remains dynamic. Any additional development proposed must conserve and enhance the AONB. Any additional development proposed will be required to be of high quality design and careful layout, provide a buffer to protect the ancient woodland, and protect priority habitats. Landscaping and planting should be integrated into the development and will be required to provide a buffer and defensible boundary in order to blend the development into the countryside in a natural and sensitive way. Respect and respond sensitively to the existing features within the site that are positive\nand that make the site unique. Fort Halstead, a designated Scheduled Monument and of\nhistoric military significance, should be protected, enhanced and better presented in any development proposal. Improve the provision and connectivity of green infrastructure including improvements to the Public Right of Way network. Multiple access points will be required to serve the development. Any scheme will need to be supported by a transport assessment, setting out any required mitigation measures, safe access for all and focusing on sustainable transport solutions.
