Planning permission is now in place for 35 homes across the overall site (14/02140/FUL). The development has yet to commence but is anticipated for completion within the next 5 years. The site is a mix of brownfield and greenfield land. The brownfield land (0.45ha) represents a small proportion of the total site area - a yield of around 7 dwellings can be calculated based on the methodological approach. For indicative purposes in the BF Register, the original SHLAA site (ref 6841) is split to reflect brownfield and greenfield elements - total area of 2.77ha.
